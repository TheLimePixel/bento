# The Bento Programming Language

Bento is a procedural functional programming language for the JVM with reference semantics and ad-hoc 
polymorphism, inspired by Rust, Swift, Kotlin and Scala. For the time being it's mostly a toy language 
used for experimenting with certain features. In fact, it isn't even fully-implemented yet.
